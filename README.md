## About US

Developer Circles from Facebook is a program designed to create locally organized communities for developers. These communities are meant to educate and provide a forum for discussion and knowledge sharing around topics that are top-of-mind for developers in a particular market.

**Why join a circle?**
Whatever you build, Developer Circles connects you to collaborate, learn, and code with other local developers.
You get to attend local meetups, collaborate in Facebook Groups and learn about the latest Facebook technologies. 

Technologies discussed here include all the products listed on this page: https://developers.facebook.com/products
